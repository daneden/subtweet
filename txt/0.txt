00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,206
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

142
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:31,126
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

143
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,296
Yeah. It makes me learn from my mistakes.

144
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,883
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable by now then.

145

My armor.

146
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:44,390
Carrying too much weight.
I need to be... I need to be faster.

147
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,226
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

148
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,895
Did you get mauled by a tiger?
It was a dog.

149
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:52,606
Huh? It was a big dog.

150
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,652
More copycats last night, Alfred, with guns.

151
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,737
Why Don't you hire them and take the weekend off?

152
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:01,740
That wasn't exactly what I had in mind...

153
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,744
...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
I know.

Well, I can't afford to know them.

And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

167
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,831
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

was the safer the operation.

00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,642
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

290
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,061
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

291
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:31,523
...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
Exactly! Who appointed the Batman?

292
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,527
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

296
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,996
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was considered a public service.

297
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:50,292
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar

and he never gave up his power.
Okay, fine.

299

301
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,262

wanna do this for the rest of his life.

302
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,682
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

394
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:34,094
All that was left in the vaults

They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved...

396
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,723
My office?

397
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,602
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking...

398
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,897
Oh, yeah Gordon, I almost had your rookie

399

400
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,365
We need Lau back...

...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

402
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:02,539
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

403
00:27:02,705 --> 00:27:03,915
I'll get him to sing.

He does that.

Without it landing.

418
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:53,131
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

419
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,301
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

420

...for getting their people out
of hot spots called Sky Hook.

421
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,640
We could look into that.
Yeah.

422
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,475
Okay. Now...

423
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:10,982
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

424
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:13,985
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

425
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:19,657
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

426
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,826
Yeah. Now, there is a tradeoff.

427
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:25,496
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

428
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:28,625
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy now, would we?

429

How will it hold up against dogs?

We talking rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

431
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:36,841
Should do fine against cats.

432
00:28:37,008 --> 00:28:39,135
I found one in Arizona.

433
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:43,473
A very nice man said he could have it up and
running in a week, and he'd take cash.

434
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,476
What about the flight crew?
South Korean smugglers.

435
00:28:46,643 --> 00:28:48,853
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar the whole way.

436
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,773
Did you think of an alibi?
Oh, yes.

437
00:29:10,541 --> 00:29:13,169
I believe this is your plane, sir.

438
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,885
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me'?

439
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,057
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

440
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,030
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,680
How about alive? Hm?

444
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,061
You wanna know how I got these scars?

445
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,983
My father was...

446
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,609
...a drinker...

447
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,028
...and a fiend.

448
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:25,033
And one night, he goes off crazier than usual.

449
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,244
Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself.

450
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:29,954
He doesn't like that...

451
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:33,583
...not one bit.

452
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,294
So, me watching...

453
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:41,049
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

454
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:44,302
He turns to me and he says:

455
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:48,139
"Why so serious?"

456
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,974
He comes at me with the knife.

457
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,560
"Why so serious?"

458
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,690
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

459
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,944
"Let's put a smile on that face."

460
00:31:03,154 --> 00:31:05,365
And...

461
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,285
Why so serious?

462
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,833
Now...

463
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,252
...our operation is small

464
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:21,339
but there is a lot of potential

465
00:31:21,506 --> 00:31:24,050
for aggressive expansion.

466
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,428
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

467
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:32,016
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

468
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:34,852
...tryouts.

Of course.

475
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:18,855
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

476
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,567
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

477
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,278
..I couldn't let such a thing threaten my company.
Of course.

478
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:28,614
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

479
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:32,743
...with you here now, we can continue.

480
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,664
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me out
here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re...

00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,717
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

485
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:51,345
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

486

...whatever it is you're accused of being.

487
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:57,185
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

488
00:32:57,351 --> 00:33:01,272
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

489
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:04,817
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think that
he was deliberately wasting your time.

490
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,611
Just accidentally wasting it.

491
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:11,782
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

492
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,910
Hey, sir.

493
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:34,138
A better view from the peak tram.

494
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,140
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

495
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,975
Restricted.

496
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:40,144
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

497
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:42,230
What's this?
I had RND work it up.

501
00:33:50,321 --> 00:33:52,490

502
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,825
And the other device?
It's in place.

What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

One minute.

charge them all as one crew on conspiracy.

532

Charge them with what?

533
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,997
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of the conspirators with a felony,

534
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:54,750
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

Mr. Lau.

536
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:03,050
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

537
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:04,844

Immunity, protection,

538
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,472
and a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
After you testify in open court.

00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:10,975
And I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,519
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

542
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:21,652
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

544
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:27,324
Well, you trust them over at County?

545
00:39:27,491 --> 00:39:29,326
I don't trust them here.

She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

Even if you blow enough smoke

But the midlevel guys, they can't.

They can't afford to be off the streets as long enough for trial and appeal.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

She is my oldest friend. Come here.

You know when Rachel first told me she was
dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

631
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:52,774
"The guy from those God-awful campaign commercials?"

632
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:56,778
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

633
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,947
But you caught Rachel's attention.

634
00:44:59,114 --> 00:45:02,117
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey

635
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,829
and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

636
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:07,789
And you know what?

637
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,335
I believe in Harvey Dent.

638
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:15,088
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

639
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:18,926
...a little safer, a
little more optimistic.

of Gotham's bright future.

00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,017
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

No, I meant every word.

645
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,455
You know that day that
you once told me about when

646
00:45:48,622 --> 00:45:50,707
Gotham would no longer need Batman?

647
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:52,793
It's coming.
Bruce.

648
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:59,216
You can't ask me to wait for that.
It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

649
00:45:59,383 --> 00:46:03,845
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

650
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,223
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

654
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,906
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the
body. Forensics found three sets of DNA.

655
00:46:23,073 --> 00:46:24,491
Any matches?
All three.

656
00:46:24,658 --> 00:46:28,161
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

657
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,330
How the Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

658
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:33,375
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

659
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:35,585
Get them both into protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

660
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:37,254
City hall.
Seal the building.

661
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,423

Got it.

663
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:57,524
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor
search of the entire building.

664
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:00,277
Sorry sir, we believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

665
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:01,862
These are dangerous people, judge.

666
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:05,907
Yeah but you're not giving me an awful lot of information.
Even we don't know where you're going.

667
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:09,411
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

668
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,167
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

669
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:18,378
The whole Mob is after you
and you're worried about these guys?

670
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:20,505
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

671
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:24,259
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

672
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:28,513
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

673
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:34,227
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

674
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,688
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

675
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,190
Yeah, I bet.

676
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,652
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

677
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,821
...about who you wanna spend
the rest of your life with.

678
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,991
That's a pretty big commitment.
Well, not if the Mob has their way.

679
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:55,916
You get to explain to my wife...

680
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:58,418
...why I'm late for dinner, lieutenant.

681
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:01,755
Sir, the joker card had traces of your DNA on it.

682
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,967
Don't do that.
All right.

683
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:09,429
Let's be serious, then.
Okay.

684
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:10,806
What's your answer?

685
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,480
I don't have an answer.

686
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:21,691
How'd they get my DNA?

687
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:24,027

to your office or house...

688

or a glass... Wait! Wait!

Harvey.

She can't stand the sight of me.

737
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,896
She leaves.

738
00:51:47,606 --> 00:51:50,025

are getting blown away.

759

If he's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mexico.

You can't even protect yourselves.

You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

you'll last in there?

765
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:54,649
Targeting me won't get their money back.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down without a fight

766
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:58,319
but this is different. They've crossed the line.
You crossed the line first, sir.

767
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:01,906
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

768
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:07,078
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

769
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:10,123
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

770

<font color="#00ff80">ALFRED:</font> With respect, Master Wayne

772
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:17,213
perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.

773
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,717
A long time ago, I was in Burma.

774
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:24,304
My friends and I were working
for the local government.

775
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:27,056
They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders

776
00:54:27,223 --> 00:54:30,059
by bribing them with precious stones.

777
00:54:30,226 --> 00:54:34,814
But their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

778
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,276
So we went looking for the stones.

779
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:43,782
But in 6 months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

780
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:48,411
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

781
00:54:48,578 --> 00:54:51,623
...the size of a tangerine.

782
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:55,251
The bandit had been throwing them away.

783
00:54:55,919 --> 00:54:58,630
So why steal them?
Well, because he thought it was good sport.

784
00:54:58,797 --> 00:55:03,760
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical like money.

785
00:55:03,927 --> 00:55:08,181
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

786
00:55:08,598 --> 00:55:12,435
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

809
00:57:35,787 --> 00:57:40,041
I went down to the archives and
I started pulling some old files.

810

there pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

and to the protection of his community.

846
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:02,243
I remember when I first took office,

847
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,954
I asked if he wanted to stay on as commissioner.

848
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:10,376
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

849
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,300
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

850
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:21,971
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

888
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:07,053

I wanna hear you talk?

<font color="#00ff80">DENT:</font> Where are <i>you?</i>

895
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:46,842
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all this mess.

896

<i>God, is there someone or anyone
in this town we can trust?</i>

901
01:05:06,362 --> 01:05:08,072
Bruce.

902
01:05:08,364 --> 01:05:09,532
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

<i>No. Rachel, come on! I know you're his
friend, but... Harvey, trust me.</i>

904
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:16,205
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

905
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:17,706
<i>Then you go straight there.</i>

906

<i>Don't tell anybody where you're going.

01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:21,877

908
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,143
I want the Joker.

909
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,020
From one professional to another...

910
01:05:40,187 --> 01:05:42,731
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

911

From this height, the fall wouldn't kill me.

You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

But you already know what that is.

You don't think I will?
Mm-mm.

No. No, I wouldn't.

935
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:55,095
That's why I'm not gonna leave it up to me.

You're not playing the odds, friend.

943
01:07:23,832 --> 01:07:25,834
Let's do it again.

944
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:30,506
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

945
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:34,843
Not exactly.
His name's Schiff, Thomas.

946
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:38,013
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

947
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:42,810
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

948
01:07:46,146 --> 01:07:48,941
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

949
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:51,902
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

950
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:53,904
Your stand against organized crime...

951
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,283
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

952
01:07:57,449 --> 01:08:01,078
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

953
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:03,539
All the criminals you pulled off the streets
would be released

954
01:08:03,706 --> 01:08:06,792
and Jim Gordon will have died for nothing.

955
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:09,670
You're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow morning.

956
01:08:09,837 --> 01:08:12,214
Why? No one else will die because of me.

957
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:14,717
Gotham's in your hands now.

958
01:08:14,883 --> 01:08:16,594
You can't.

959
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,137
You can't give in.

960
01:08:18,429 --> 01:08:20,973
You can't give in!

961
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:37,573
Harvey called.

962
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,784
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

963
01:08:40,951 --> 01:08:42,077
I have no choice.

964
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:45,331
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

965
01:08:45,497 --> 01:08:48,959
Maybe not. But I have enough blood on my hands.

966
01:08:49,418 --> 01:08:54,256
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

967
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,260
You once told me that if the day
came when I was finished,

968
01:08:58,427 --> 01:09:00,512
that we'd be together.

969
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:04,391
Bruce, don't make me your one
hope for a normal life.

970
01:09:05,934 --> 01:09:07,269
Did you mean it?

971
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:10,606
Yes.

972
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:29,667
Bruce.

973
01:09:30,626 --> 01:09:34,546
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

974
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:48,143
<font color="#00ff80">ALFRED: </font>Logs as well?
<font color="#00ff80">BRUCE:</font> Everything.

01:09:57,027 --> 01:10:00,322
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

977
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:04,243
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

978
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:08,122
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

979
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:13,836
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

980
01:10:14,002 --> 01:10:15,337
The right choice.

981
01:10:15,838 --> 01:10:18,882
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

982
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,300
He can't endure this.

983
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:23,470
Today you get to say "I told you so."

984
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:27,224
Today, I don't want to.

985
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:34,523
But I did bloody tell you.

Ladies and gentlemen,thank you for coming.
I've called this press conference for two reasons.

991
01:10:55,502 --> 01:10:57,546
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

992
01:10:57,713 --> 01:11:01,383
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

993
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,593
<font color="#00ff80"><font color="#00ff80">[CHATTERING]</font></font>

994
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,846
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

995
01:11:06,013 --> 01:11:07,723
<i>But let's consider the situation.</i>

996
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,726
Should we give in to this terrorist's demands?

997
01:11:10,893 --> 01:11:12,352
Do we really think he's gonna...?

998
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:15,898
Would you rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

999
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:18,442
The Batman is an outlaw.

1000
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:23,071
That's not why we're demanding he turn himself in.
We're doing it because we're scared.

1001
01:11:23,238 --> 01:11:26,033
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets for us until now.

1002
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,161
<font color="#00ff80">MAN 1</font>: Things are worse than ever!
<font color="#00ff80">MAN 2:</font> Amen.

1003
01:11:30,496 --> 01:11:32,414
Yes, they are.

1004
01:11:34,917 --> 01:11:37,920
But the night is darkest just before the dawn.

1005
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,466
I promise you...

1006
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:44,676
...the dawn is coming.

1007
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:49,389
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

1008
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,308
...not to this madman.

1009
01:11:51,475 --> 01:11:53,811

<font color="#00ff80">OFFICERS:</font> Yeah!

1014

01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,122
<font color="#00ff80">MAN 6:</font> What?
<font color="#00ff80">MAN 7:</font> Come on.

<font color="#00ff80">RACHEL:</font> Alfred.

1017
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:27,553
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

1018
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:30,722
He went down to the press conference.
I know. He just stood by.

1019
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:32,975
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent

1020
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:36,144
believe that Batman stands for
something more important

1021
01:12:36,311 --> 01:12:38,647
than the whims of a terrorist, Miss Dawes

1022
01:12:38,814 --> 01:12:40,816
even if everyone hates him for it.

1023
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:43,110
That's the sacrifice he's making.

1024
01:12:43,277 --> 01:12:46,905
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

1025
01:12:47,447 --> 01:12:49,074
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

1026
01:12:49,241 --> 01:12:52,327
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

1027
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:56,623
You know him better than anyone.

1028
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,083
I do.

1029
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:04,506
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

1030
01:13:05,966 --> 01:13:07,175
How will I know?

1031
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:08,844
It's not sealed.

1032
01:13:10,262 --> 01:13:11,805
Goodbye, Alfred.

1033

1185
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:38,463
You let five people die.

1186

Then you let Dent take your place.

Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were.

Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1204
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,858
...it's a bad joke.

1205

Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1206
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:49,116
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1207

He's in control.
I have one rule.

1215

Oh. Then that's the rule you'll
have to break to know the truth.

1216

1337

...not madness, not death.

in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

Didn't you think there might be some casualties?

No, Gotham needs its true hero

blow him half to hell.

Yes.

1374

Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1398

1484
01:46:30,260 --> 01:46:32,053
Davis.

1485
01:46:37,183 --> 01:46:39,519

Hi.

1500
01:47:53,093 --> 01:47:54,594
You know...

1501
01:47:55,428 --> 01:47:58,515
I don't want there to be any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1502
01:47:58,682 --> 01:48:01,810
When you and...
Rachel!

1503
01:48:01,977 --> 01:48:04,270
...Rachel were being abducted,

1504
01:48:04,437 --> 01:48:07,440
I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1505
01:48:07,774 --> 01:48:09,693
No I didn't rig those charges.

1506
01:48:09,901 --> 01:48:12,362
Your men, your plan.

1507
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:15,031
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1508
01:48:15,448 --> 01:48:18,243
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1509
01:48:18,868 --> 01:48:21,329
I wouldn't know what to do with one if I caught it.

1510
01:48:21,496 --> 01:48:24,624
You know? I just do things.

1511
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,712
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1512
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:31,089
Gordon's got plans.

1513
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:34,217
You know, they're schemers.

1514
01:48:34,384 --> 01:48:38,138
Schemers trying to control their little worlds.

1515
01:48:38,304 --> 01:48:39,806
I'm not a schemer.

1516
01:48:39,973 --> 01:48:41,599
I try to show the schemers

1517
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:47,063
how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1518
01:48:48,023 --> 01:48:51,067
So when I say... Ah. Come here.

1519
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:55,113
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal,

1520
01:48:56,656 --> 01:48:58,867
you know that I'm telling the truth.

1521
01:49:01,369 --> 01:49:04,164
I'm gonna need your weapon.
Why?

1522
01:49:07,917 --> 01:49:09,753
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1523
01:49:10,462 --> 01:49:12,005
Yeah, that'd be why.

1524
01:49:12,922 --> 01:49:16,134
It's the schemers that put you where you are.

1525
01:49:16,301 --> 01:49:20,096
You were a schemer, you had plans

1526
01:49:20,263 --> 01:49:22,432
and look where that got you.

1529
01:49:38,031 --> 01:49:40,575
I just did what I do best.

1530
01:49:40,742 --> 01:49:44,370
I took your little plan and I turned it on itself.

1531
01:49:44,537 --> 01:49:49,876
Look what I did to this city with a few
drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1532
01:49:50,043 --> 01:49:53,338
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1533
01:49:53,505 --> 01:49:57,050
Nobody panics when things go "according to plan."

1534
01:49:57,217 --> 01:49:58,885
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1535
01:49:59,511 --> 01:50:04,557
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1536
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:08,186
...or a truckload of soldiers will be blowing up...

1537
01:50:08,478 --> 01:50:09,562
...nobody panics.

1538
01:50:10,271 --> 01:50:13,358
Because it's all part of the plan.

1539
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:18,446
But when I say that one little old mayor will die,

1540
01:50:18,696 --> 01:50:21,116
well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1541
01:50:24,536 --> 01:50:27,455
Introduce a little anarchy...

1542
01:50:28,623 --> 01:50:30,875
...upset the established order...

1543
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:35,588
...and everything becomes chaos.

1544

Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?

1546
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:46,558
It's fair.

1547
01:50:55,775 --> 01:50:58,945
You live.
Mm-hm.

1548
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:01,072

they don't have an option.

1633
01:57:14,153 --> 01:57:16,989
And land routes east?
Backed up for per hours.

1634
01:57:17,156 --> 01:57:20,785
Which just leaves the ferries with 30,000 ready to board.

1635
01:57:20,952 --> 01:57:23,996
Plus I wanna use the ferries so I can get

Whatever the Joker's planning,

1638
01:57:29,585 --> 01:57:34,090
it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners might be
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

Yes.

to listen to her die?

1646

Look, take it up with the Joker.

1647
01:58:17,883 --> 01:58:21,137

your other man inside Gordon's unit?

Must have been someone she trusted.

02:17:18,189 --> 02:17:20,066
I'm sorry!

1916
02:17:21,860 --> 02:17:22,944
For everything.

1917
02:17:25,530 --> 02:17:27,741
Please don't hurt my son.

1920
02:17:37,876 --> 02:17:39,461
You brought your cops?

1921
02:17:39,627 --> 02:17:42,505
All they know is this is a situation.

1922
02:17:42,672 --> 02:17:45,675
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1923
02:17:45,842 --> 02:17:48,511
You think I wanna escape from this?

1924
02:17:48,678 --> 02:17:51,431
There is no escape from this.

1925
02:17:51,598 --> 02:17:53,725
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1926
02:17:56,019 --> 02:17:59,230
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1927
02:17:59,981 --> 02:18:04,194
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1928
02:18:06,988 --> 02:18:08,072
But you were wrong.

1929
02:18:08,782 --> 02:18:12,577
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1930
02:18:13,328 --> 02:18:15,246
...is chance.

1931
02:18:15,413 --> 02:18:17,123
Unbiased.

1932
02:18:17,332 --> 02:18:18,583
Unprejudiced.

1933
02:18:19,959 --> 02:18:21,085
Fair.

1934
02:18:21,252 --> 02:18:23,505
His son's got the same chance she had.

1935
02:18:24,255 --> 02:18:25,548
Fifty-fifty.

1936
02:18:25,715 --> 02:18:29,177
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1937
02:18:29,511 --> 02:18:30,845
We three.

1938
02:18:31,012 --> 02:18:34,432
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1939
02:18:36,935 --> 02:18:39,562
It wasn't.
The Joker chose me.

1940
02:18:39,729 --> 02:18:42,023
Because you were the best of us.

1941
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:47,195
He wanted to prove that even someone as good as you...

1942
02:18:47,362 --> 02:18:49,113
...could fall.

1943
02:18:49,447 --> 02:18:50,740
And he was right.

1944
02:18:50,907 --> 02:18:53,159
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1945
02:18:53,326 --> 02:18:56,371
So point it at the people responsible.

1946
02:18:57,330 --> 02:18:59,165
Fair enough.

1947
02:19:02,502 --> 02:19:04,379
You first.

1948
02:19:16,891 --> 02:19:18,560
My turn.

1949
02:19:25,483 --> 02:19:27,485
Harvey, you're right.

1950
02:19:28,528 --> 02:19:31,155
Rachel's death was my fault.

1951
02:19:34,242 --> 02:19:36,703
Please don't punish the boy.

1952
02:19:37,787 --> 02:19:40,999
Please, punish me.
I'm about to.

1953
02:19:42,959 --> 02:19:44,919
Tell your boy he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1954
02:19:45,378 --> 02:19:47,005
Lie...

1955
02:19:47,505 --> 02:19:48,631
...like I lied.

1956
02:19:52,385 --> 02:19:53,970
It's going to be all right, son.

You don't have to thank me.

1962
02:20:54,530 --> 02:20:56,324
Yes, I do.

1963
02:21:00,578 --> 02:21:01,913
The Joker won.

1964
02:21:04,332 --> 02:21:07,210
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1965
02:21:07,752 --> 02:21:09,504
"undone.

1966
02:21:10,004 --> 02:21:14,926
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1967
02:21:15,093 --> 02:21:16,260
We bet it all on him.

1968
02:21:17,595 --> 02:21:20,473
The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.

1969
02:21:21,057 --> 02:21:22,475
People will lose hope.

1970
02:21:22,642 --> 02:21:24,394
They won't.

1971
02:21:26,896 --> 02:21:28,773
They must never know what he did.

1972
02:21:28,940 --> 02:21:30,775
Five dead.

1973
02:21:31,067 --> 02:21:34,988
Two of them cops. You can't sweep that...
No.

1974
02:21:39,784 --> 02:21:42,620
But the Joker cannot win.

1975
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:51,087
Gotham needs its true hero.

1976
02:21:57,468 --> 02:22:00,513
No.
You either die a hero...

1977
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:05,143
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1978
02:22:05,309 --> 02:22:07,145
I can do those things...

1979
02:22:07,562 --> 02:22:10,606
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1980
02:22:13,609 --> 02:22:16,487
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1981
02:22:16,654 --> 02:22:18,573
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1982
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:21,325
